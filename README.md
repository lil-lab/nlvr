# Natural Language for Visual Reasoning

This repository contains data for [NLVR](https://github.com/clic-lab/nlvr/tree/master/nlvr) (Suhr et al. 2017) and [NLVR2](https://github.com/clic-lab/nlvr/tree/master/nlvr2) (Suhr and Zhou et al. 2018).

The Natural Language for Visual Reasoning corpora use the task of determining whether a sentence is true about a visual input, like an image. This task focuses on reasoning about sets of objects, comparisons, and spatial relations. This includes two datasets: NLVR, with synthetically generated images, and NLVR2, which includes natural photographs.
